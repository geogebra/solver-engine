/**
 * This class represents a Graspable Math (GM) action that can be performed by
 * the user to mimic a solver transformation. It describes the type of the
 * interaction, and a list of expressions that the user should interact with
 * (usually one, except for DragCollect (>1) or NotSupported (0)). If the type of
 * the action is Drag or DragCollect, then the action also contains information
 * about where to drag the expressions. If the type of the action is Formula, a
 * GM formulaId is provided.
 *
 * PathModifiers can be provided for the expressions and target expression to
 * refer to parts of the expressions that can't be expressed with solver path
 * notation.
