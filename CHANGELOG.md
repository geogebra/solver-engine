# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

An entry should be added to the _[Unreleased]_ section when committing to main. When a release is made we move its
contents to a new release section (e.g. _[0.x]_).
