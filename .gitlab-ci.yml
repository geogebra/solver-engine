stages:
  - checks
  - build
  - publish
  - deploy

# Here we define all the variables that configure whether and how the jobs are run.
#
# The strategy is to:
# - deploy SDK and engine in development branches and staging
# - deploy only the SDK when committing to $RELEASE_BRANCH
# - deploy only the engine when a release-x.y.z tag is created
#
# This means that to deploy a new release the steps are as follows
# 1. Create a "release-x.y.0" tag on the staging branch. This will deploy the engine version "x.y".
# 2. Merge staging into $RELEASE_BRANCH. This should trigger an SDK release with the SDK pointing to the x.y API URL.
# 3. Merge $RELEASE_BRANCH back into main.  This is to keep semantic-release happy. (See https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/workflow-configuration)
#
# Once we have a release "x.y.z" we can
# - deploy a patch release by creating a new "release-x.y.(z + 1)" tag on the release branch (this will overwrite the
#   existing x.y release)
# - release a new SDK simply by adding commits to $RELEASE_BRANCH that contain "fix:" or "feat:" commit messages
#
# This strategy means that several minor release versions can be deployed simultaneously.  So it is up to us
# to delete deployments of old releases.
#
# To deploy the engine, the following variables must be set
# - SOLVER_VERSION: something like 1.2 for release versions, plut-652 for development branch, main for the main branch
# - SOLVER_IMAGE_TAG: the container image tag for the solver image, must be different for distinct deployments
# - SOLVER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: a name used to create a k8s namespace and a gitlab environment.  Reuse the same name to
#   update a deployment (e.g. when releasing a patch version, or for any development branch)
# - SOLVER_DEPLOYMENT_DOMAIN: the DNS domain where the solver deployment will be available
#
# These variables are required but computed from the ones above
# - SOLVER_CONTEXT_PATH: the path at which the solver API root is accessible (e.g. /main, /1.2, /plut-654)
# - SOLVER_BASE_URL: the base URL for accessing the solver deployment
# - POKER_URL: The URL where the poker can be reached (it extends $SOLVER_BASE_URL)
#
# To deploy the SDK, the following variables must be set
# - SOLVER_VERSION: something like 1.2 for release versions, plut-652 for development branch, main for the main branch
# - SOLVER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: a name used to create a k8s namespace and a gitlab environment.  Reuse the same name to
#
# The following variables are required but computed from the ones above
# - API_URL: the URL where the solver API can be accessed (it extends $SOLVER_BASE_URL)
